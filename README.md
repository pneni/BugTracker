Practice application on Node Express React and mongo


"Hello World"

Step 1: 
	1. Create an index.html file on your filesystem with (almost) the same contents as the quick start.
	2. Replace the scripts build/react.js and build/react-dom.js with the ones from the CDN, so that it looks like the one in the Tutorial.
	3. Open index.html in a browser
	
Step 2: Serve it up
	1.Install nvm and the latest version of Node. 
	2. Run npm init and install express as per the Express Installation instructions.. Remember to use --save. We'll be using --save in pretty much all our npm installs.
	3.Use webapp.js as the entry point for the node server when you do npm init.
	4.Create a simple static file server to serve the index.html, which shall be placed under the directory static.
	5.Run the server using node webapp.js and point your browser to localhost:3000.
